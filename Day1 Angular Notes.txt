Angular
Angular is a javascript framework which is used for creating reactive single page application
Angular is used for front end application development 

AngularJS 1.x

Angular 2.0,Angular 5, Angular 6.0, Angular 7.0, Angular 8.0, Angular 9,Angular 14.

what is a SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION?
these application provides user with a very fluid, reactive and fast experience similar to desktop application

Web Application
When user clicks on any controls , entire new page is loaded everytime from the server 

SPA
when user clicks on any controls, entire page is loaded once and only the functionalities of the events is dynamically executed in the current page
rather than loading the entire new page from the server. So these SPA pages are faster in speed


Features of Angular
angular supports cross platform
we can execute the angular application on LINUX, MAc, Android

It is used for creating progressive application
mordern webplatform capabilities to deliver high speed application,offline,zero step installation apps


Angular FSD -> Full Stack Development
Angular is a complete framework of Javascript
Testing ->we are testing if our application is bug free
Angular provides karma abd jasmine for unit testing
karma is a javascript based test runner tool
jasmine is testing framework for angular apps

Animation Support -> high end choreography applications can be developed using angular
Accessibility -> any devices we can access angular pages

Angular is front end application development
Thru RESTAPI we can access backend(DB) also from Angular Application

install angular
npm install -g @angular/cli

create a new angular project
ng new <projectname>

angular has a server in which the angular pages will be hosted
to start the angular server
cd to angular project
ng serve -o  -> server will run on port no 4200

why does angular require server?
Angular code is written in typescript .
Typescript pages has to be compiled and converted to JS file
for compiling the angular code we need the server

6 components of angular
app.component.css

common styles which is used by all the web pages created in angular is defined here


app.component.html- is the front page of the app.


app.component.spec.ts -> unit testing code is written in this file which will be compiled using jasmine and karma javascript test tool will run the test cases


app.component.ts -> code behind file(.aspx.cs), controller file(MVC)
we can write methods, variables, constructor and we can show the o/p of the variables or methods in the associated .html file of it
to display the values from the ts file in html , 
{{}}-> interpolation operator
it will display the values of a variable or o/p of a method defined in .ts file in .html

app.module.ts
is also a typescript file
all dependencies which has to be imported has to be imported in this file


app.routing.module.ts
this is similar to routeconfig.cs in mVc
it is used to define different page links

package.json

it is a npm configuration file
it will include details about the packages installed for the angular project

any external resource like images, audio files, video files if we want to use in our angular project
/app/assets
create a folder images. add few images which we can refer in the project

index.html -> which is the html file executed in the browser

index.html -> <body> <app-root></app-root>
<app-root> -> is the selector name for app-component.ts
app-component.ts -> app.component.html

entry point ts file which gets compiled if any code change is detected
main.ts -> it will be the first to run and it will initialize all the global configuration


we need web pages to be created when we are creating an angular project
We cannot specify all the design and all the code behind logic in a single file
app.component.html and app.component.ts

we start creating components(angular) -> asp.net it is creating different web forms
we can create modules
we can create services

web pages of a web application is called components in angular
we can create many components
we can invoke these components in app.component.html


to create different components 
ng g c <componentname> or
ng generate component <componentname>

create a new component called Calculator
Accept input of 2 numbers
and an op *,/,+,-

Based on the operator calculate on 2 numbers and display the result

<input type="text" #txtnum> -> Simple Forms used for DataBinding
----

2 types of forms supported in Angular

Reactive Forms


Template Forms


Both these forms are used to collect user input, execute events , validate the user input 

Reactive Form 
These forms are most widely preferred
These forms reusable, testable forms
To create a reactive form, the following library which we are using has to be registered in app.module.ts 

import {ReactiveFormsModule} from '@angular/forms';

imports ->ReactiveFormsModule

formGroup -> when the form has collection of controls and we need to track the values or track the status if values has changed , then we refer the entire form using <form [formGroup]="name">

Submit -> data has to be submitted -> (ngSubmit)="methodname()"
Button-> click ->(click)="methodname()"

formControlName -> we can get the value of every control
we can perform validation also
<input type="text" identify the control to gets its value using formControlName="anyname"/>


within the html file if angular script has to do validation
if condition is given using *ngIf
for loop is given using *ngFor
